1. We have written this code in c++ language so we need a c++ compiler for it.
2. We can run this "Code_DNA.cpp" file to check our encoding and decoding scheme.
3. We can change the "strSize" variable in the "main" function for the selecting 
the string's length of our choice.   
4. Currently, please just select the length to a multiple of 3 and 4 both.
e.g, 12, 24, 48, 60, 600 etc.
